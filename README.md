## About me

Hello there, my name is Brett Bowley. As it stands, I am currently pursuing a degree in web development, but my ultimate dream is to design games. Do you want to know why I love games so much? The answer is that you can create a world in your own vision. It could be set in space or in World War II, or anywhere you can imagine. That's the beautiful thing about game development; it can be anything you want it to be, and you get to make the rules. You may be wondering how I make my games. Simply put, I use an engine called Unity. This is a 3D or 2D engine, and I usually develop 3D games, though I have made 2D games before. My first game was in 2D and was called "The Untitled Bear Game." You may be wondering why it's called that. Well, I'm never good with names, and the project was never finished. It's more like a half-working game. If you'd like to try it, click on the link. But enough about "The Untitled Bear Game." One of my favorite things to do inside of Unity is trying to make time games. People often ponder the idea of reversing time, but inside of a video game, you can do that, and it's so cool. One of my favorite games to play is "Space Engineers" because you can explore the cosmos. That's a little bit about me. I hope you enjoyed learning about me today, and I wish you a great day.
