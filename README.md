## About me

Hello, there. my name is Brett Bowley. as it stands right now I'm trying to get a degree inside of web development. But my dream is to design games in the end. would you like to know why I love games so much. The answer to that question is that you create a world in your vision it could be in space or it a place in World War II or anywhere you can imagine. That's the beautiful thing about game development. It could be anything you wanted to be and you make the rules.

You may be asking how I make my games. simply put it I use an engine called Unity this is a 3D engine or 2D engine. Usually, develop 3D games. but I have done 2D games before. actually, my first game was in 2D. it was called the Untitled bear game. you may be asking why it's called the Untitled bear game. because I'm never good with names and the project was never finished. it's more like a half-working game. If you would like to try it click on link .But enough of the Untitled bear game. One of my favorite things to do inside of unity is trying to make Time games. people Ponder the idea of reversing time. but inside of a video game, you can do that And it's so cool. one of my favorite games to play is space engineers because you can explore the cosmos.

But that's a little about me. I hope you enjoyed what you've learned about me today and I hope you have a great day.
